Components:

1. Personal Info
   Name, email, phone number, address, role/occupation
2. Educational Experience
   School, area of study, date of study
3. Practical Experience
   Company name, position title, job description, job dates

Each instance of education should be one component that is placed into an overarching 'education' div... same goes for job experience and skills if we add them. Personal info won't have multiple instances so that won't be neccessary there
